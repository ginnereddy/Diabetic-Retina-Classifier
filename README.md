# Diabetic-Retina-Classifier
Classifies retina images as diabetic or non-diabetic. A series of preprocessing steps are applied on the images to highlight hemorrhages and exudates. Choosing these as the candidates, the image is quantified and using a 6-fold cross validation classifier, the retina in the image is classified as diseased or not.
